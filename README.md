- Hello!! I hope you're doing well today or tonight!
- Nothing much to put here, I just want to reiterate for you not to copy my skins please!
- Inspo is fine if you have an understanding of what inspo is, if you're confused pls whisp and ask idm explaining at all! (With that said, do *not* take HEAVY inspo, if everything is basically the same with one or two changes I'd consider that to be heavy inspo.
- To help prevent this from happening like it has in the past I'd even go as far as to help you make a skin if you'd like with aspects of what you like from my skin*s* /srs
